## You can visit Petful [here](https://focused-franklin-d5aa36.netlify.com) 

## What does it do?
Well I'm glad you asked. For too long I've hear people complain saying, "I hate being to adopt any animal that I want!" or "There are just TOO many good dogs/cats to choose from!!"
Well thanks to me(you're welcome) you can allow Petful to select your pet for you.
We use an extremely complicated alogrithm that your peanut brain probably couldn't understand so probably best to not worry about it too much.
